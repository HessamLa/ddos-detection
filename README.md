# ddos-detection
The objective in developing this program, as part of a research, was for DDoS attack detection and mitigation. The incoming traffic statistics is aggregated in the form of flow-table, then converted to corresponding time series data. From then on, it is a time series analysis problem. Initial part of this research is published in the following work.
